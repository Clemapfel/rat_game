# On Randomness In Competitive Games

## Abstract


## Introduction

Determinisim, is a feature of a game in which the game state of a depends solely on the past game state and the actions of both players, there is no other factor influencing any part of a game. Such a game can be considered fair, as only players skill has impact on their chance to win. Regardless, in reality randomness is a core feature of almost any competitive video game, indeed it is hard to come up with an example for a popular competitive game that is entirely deterministic. Even chess has a coinflip at the start of the game to decide who goes first, though on a spectrum from fully deterministic to completely random, chess sits very close to the determinism angle. Somewhere towards the right are competitive card games such as Yu-Gi-Oh! or Magic the Gathering, both feature copious amounts of randomness in what cards each player draws, while some card's effects explicitly use dice or coins. Yet still, most people would call these cards games "competitive" and would agree that skill of a player has a large influence on who wins the game, than luck.

Super Smash Brothers, a competitive fighting game, at first seems entirely determinstic. The rules governing both players character are entirely consistent, and matches are an intense display of skill. Looking closer, however, smash features some full non-determinstic elements, for example a move kirby can use has a 30% chance to tripping the opponent, momentarily stunning them. Whether the move trips or does not is entirely decided on a coin flip. Luckily, kirby is not a very viable character so there are no cases in which an important tournament was decided on the coin flip, but one can easily imagine a scenario in which kirby is the best character and all players will play only him, winning the finale of a tournament on getting a lucky trip.

Pokémon features copious amounts of randomness, and it should, the casual game is about collecting monsters, the more variance there is between each individual pokemon, the more exciting it is to get a good one. There is a competitive branch of pokémon, however. One popular one uses the [Smogon Tiering System](<TODO>) which
