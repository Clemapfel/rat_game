# 2. Mechanics

## 2.1 Entities

## 2.1.x Stats

Each entity has four properties associated with it, called ATK (attack), DEF (defense), SPD (speed), HP (hit points), and a hidden priority stat. At the start of each turn, all entites in the battle are sorted by SPD, descending, then that turns action order is determined. The fastest entity acts first within its priority bracket. If the priority of two entities is the same, the entity with the higher SPD stat acts first. If the priority is different, the entity with the higher priority acts first.

If two entities have the same SPD and priority, the entity whos cleartext-name is lexicographically less than the other acts first.

ATK, DEF and SPD have an associated level, which is one of `(-infinity, -3, -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3, +infinity)`. A stats level modifies the actual value that will be used for calculations like so:

| level     | factor   |
|-----------|----------|
| -3        | 1 - 3/4  |
| -2        | 1 - 1/2  |
| -1        | 1 - 1/4  |
| 0         | 1        |
| +1        | 1.25     |
| +2        | 1.5      |
| +3        | 2        |
| +infinity | infinity |
| -infinity | 0        |

Stats may only be modified mid-battle by means of these levels. Outside of battle, an entites stat depends on other properties: the stats base, the stats allocated EV, and equipment modification.

The base level is unique to each entity and cannot be modified by items, equipments, or in-battle effects, it is chosen by the developer. This is the easiest way to modify an entites power level, by choosing higher base stats the entity is strong and faster. 

For party members only, each stat has an associated EV level which is a number in `{0, 1, ..., 15}`. For each point, the entity gets a +10 to its base. For example, for an entity with a base hp of 150, allocated 3 EVs to hp ill increase the base hp to 180. Each entity has a fixed number of EVs, that can be allocated to any stat (up to the maximum). In this way, the player can choose to specialize certain characters into roles they are needed. EVs can be reallocated at all times, therefore rewarding the player with an EV for a specific character essentially buffs that character, making EVs a sought-after reward.

## 2.1.x Status Ailments

An entity can have any number of status ailments while in battle. While afflicted by a status condition, an emblem representing it is shown next to the entities HP bar, or below the enemy sprite if the entity is an enemy. Part of the emble is a numerical symbol, which displays the number of turns left until the status is cured automatically.

The game keeps track of how many turns have passed since the entity was first afflicted with a specific status condition. This number is incremented at the start of each turn, if the number is equal to or exceeds the maximum duration of a status ailment, it is cured automatically. Other than this, status ailments may be cured by items or moves.

### 2.1.1 Knocked Out

Status ailments can have a wide variety of effects, with one special case, the `KNOCKED_OUT` status ailment.

If an entities HP reaches 0, it is knocked out. All other status ailments are cured and for the rest of that turn, the entity is invulnerable to all damage. Starting the next turn, if the entity takes any amount of damage it is killed. If this happens to an enemy, that enemy is removed from the battle permanently. If a party member is killed, the player receives a game over. If all alive enemies are currently knocked out and no enemy has died so far, the battle ends in non-standard way, usually rewarding the player with an achievement or bonus item.

While an entity is knocked out, if it receives any amount of healing the enemey is restored with an HP value equal to the healing amount. 

Outside of battle, an entity cannot have a status ailment and all are healed when a battle ends. This includes `KNOCKED_OUT`: after the battle the entites HP is set to 1.

### 2.1.4 Example Status Conditions

Where the effect text is written for the purposes of being clear to the developer, the actual in-game text will be more brief and less technical.

> ``STUNNED``<br>
> Duraton: 1 Turn<br>
> Target may not act this turn.

> ``BLEEDING``<br>
> Duraton: 5 Turns<br>
> Target takes 1/8 * target.max_hp damage at the end of each turn. If the target is healed by any amount, this status is removed.

> ``POISONED``<br>
> Duraton: Infinite<br>
> Target takes 1/16 * target.max_hp damage at the end of each turn. If the target would be knocked out, this status is cured instead and target.current_hp is set to 1

> ``BURNED``<br>
> Duraton: Infinite<br>
> Reduces DEF by 50%. Target receives 1/16 * target.max_hp damage at the end of each turn. If target would receive the `CHILLED` status, `BURNED` is cured instead.

> ``CHILLED``<br>
> Duraton: Infinite<br>
> SPD is reduced by 50%. If the `CHILLED` status would be added while a target is already chilled, `CHILLED` is cured and the `FROZEN` status will be added. If target would receive the `BURNED` status, `CHILLED`is cured instead.

> ``FROZEN``<br>
> Duraton: Infinite<br>
> Target SPD is treated as negative infinity at all times. If target would receive the `BURNED` status, `FROZEN` is cured instead.

> ``BLINDED``<br>
> Duraton: 1 Turn<br>
> Target ATK is treated as 0 at all times.

> ``AT_RISK``<br>
> Duraton: 3 Turns<br>
> If target would be knocked out by any means, it instead immediately dies.

> ``ACCELERATED_STATUS``<br>
> Duraton: Infinite<br>
> At the start of a turn, if the elapsed turn counter of any status ailment is increased, it is instead increased by 2

> ``DECELERATED_STATUS`` <br>
> Duration: 3 Turns
> At the start of any even-numbered turn count (turn 2, 4, ...), elapsed turn counter of any status ailment other than `DELECERATE_STATUS` is not increased.

> ``PARALYZED``<br>
> Duraton: Infinite<br>
> Raises SPD by 50%. Every 2nd turn, after `PARALYZED` is gained, target may not act that turn.

Note that since `PARALYZED` technically has a beneficial effect on the first turn, it may be a good strategy to inflict this status ailment on one of our party members. In a similar way, knocking out one of the party members and immediately healing them that turn is a sneaky way to cure all status ailments, since being knocked out removes all others. This technique is not taught to the player, but is rewarded due to the inherent properties of being knocked out.

### 2.1.5 Status Ailment Implementation

The class representing volatile and non-volatile status conditions has the following gameplay-relevant fields.

```c
class StatusAilment {
    unsigned int max_duration       // maximum duration, may be infinite
    unsigned int elapsed_duration   // current elapsed time
    
    float attack_modifier       // in [0, n], where 1 is no change
    float defense_modifier
    float speed_modifier
    
    Function on_turn_start      // (self) -> void
    Function on_turn_end        // (self) -> void
    
    Function on_action_taken    // (self, action, origin, damage) -> void
    Function on_action_dealt    // (self, action, target, damage) -> void
    
    Function on_status_given    // (self) -> void
    Function on_status_removed  // (self) -> void
}
```

Where `on_status_given` activates when the entity receives this status condition, which can be used to apply permanent effects, `on_status_removed` is called after the current status ailment was removed in any way, including being knocked out.

The `elapsed_duration` is updated automatically at the end of each turn. If `elapsed` is equal to or higher than `max_duration`, the status is removed automatically. 

## 2.2 Actions

Actions are a serious of commands that entities can execute. During each turn of the battle, an entity chooses exactly one action, which is resolved when it is that entities turn during the turn order.

Actions can have any effect, though most related to modifying properties of another entity, such as their HP stat for healing / damaging moves, or adding a status condition.

Actions can be classified into three camps: moves, intrinsic moves, and consumables. Again, an entity may choose exactly one of any of these actions each turn. The classification is based on how the resource system for that type of action works.

Moves and intrinsic moves have a number of PP (power points), which works exactly as in pokÃ©mon. Each move has a set number of maximum PP. When the move is first equipped to a specific entity, that entity will have an associated number of current PP, which are decremented any time the move is used. If a move has 0 PP, it cannot be used. PP are restored at each overworld savepoints, making managing PP part of gameplay.

Intrinsic moves are move with an infinte number of PP. This means they cannot be exhausted under any circumstances and the play may always choose an intrinsic moves. 

Intrisic moves act as a fail-safe, if all PP of all other moves are exhausted, an entity would have no way of acting. Furthermore, intrinsic moves offer an opportunity for character development, as each party member and many of the enemies will have intrinsic moves unique to them.

All entities share the following intrinsic move

> `STRIKE`<br>
> Deal 1 * user.attack to single target

It's purpose is obvious. Additionally, all party members except for $WILDCARD and $GIRL share the following intrinsic move (note that this description is for developers, the actual in-game text will be much less technical):

> `PROTECT`<br>
> Self or target ally is invulnerable to all damage and status conditions for the rest of the turn. Continous conditions that activate at the end of a turn still active. Moves that would increase an entites stat level are still applied, but only if they do not deal damage or add a status ailment. If an entity is targeted by `PROTECT` for two turns in a row, `PROTECT` will fail.

This move is similar to an traditional jRPGs block command, but in reality is modeled off of the [pokÃ©mon move of the same name](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Protect_(move)). `PROTECT` is a necessary part of rat_games battle system, as it allows players to strategically avoid the effect of powerful moves, while the not-twice-in-a-row restriction prevents overly defensive play. Note also that if an entity is protecting another entity, it may not protect itself, meaning for any party with a member that does not have `PROTECT`, it is impossible to prevent all damage to all party members for a turn.

Another intrinsic move that is expected to be relevant in almost any battle is $PROFs signature move:

> `ANALYZE`<br>
> Singular target enemy gains a permanent, hidden status condition. While afflicted, that enemies HP fraction (target.hp / target.hp_base) is shown through the battle UI

By default, an enemies HP is completely hidden from the player. After `ANALYZE`, the exact value of both the current and maximum number of HP is still obfuscated, but a simple level bar gives the player some amount of information as to how much HP a specific entity has left. Party members have their exact HP value displayed at all times.

Note that the effect of `ANALYZE` can be modified through equipment, adding effects such as activating automatically once per turn without taking that turn, revealing the enemies exact speed stat, the PP of all moves used at least once this battle, or being applied to all enemies instead of just one. 

$GIRLs signature move is (recall that she does not have `PROTECT` available)

> `WISH`<br>
> Self or single target ally will be healed for 0.5 * user.hp_base at the start of the second turn after activation

To clarify, if girl has 300 max HP and her target has 200 max HP, then the turn wish is used nothing happens. Then, the turn after, that target is healed for 150 HP

This move is special in terms of game design, as rat_game has extremely limited healing. No move will just restore health, and if it does it's PP will be severly limited, such as being exactly 1. This is intended to avoid the old jRPG problem of having on healer character which does nothing but heal and buff the party. 

While no move the player will ever be able to use will have the effect of "just" healing an entity, the third class of actions will have this effect semi-frequently.

## 2.3 Consumables

Consumables are identical to moves in terms of effect and function, with two main differences. Rather than having a fixed number of PP, consumables are permanently consumed upon use. Each entity can carry a fixed number of consumables, and consumables may stack, meaning if an entity has 3 potions, it can use that consumable up to three times.

> `POTION`<br>
> User gains +2 priority until the end of turn. Heal target ally or enemy for 1 HP.

While `POTION` may at first seem like a joke, restoring only 1 HP, it is actually extremely useful for avoiding game overs. Because of + 2 priority, an ally that is currently knocked out will be healed at the start of the turn before an enemy has the chance to kill them permanently. If the enemy still chooses to attack, the ally is knocked out again but thus made invulnerable until the end of the turn. This combined with being able to target a knocked out ally with `PROTECT` is the main mechanism of avoiding game overs by party member death.

While consumables have the same design space as actions in terms of their effect, as a designer it is easier to justify putting a very powerful ability on a consumable, as opposed to a move, meaning the player will only ever get to use it once.

> `STUTTER_POTION`<br>
> Choose one of users moves that has 0 PP. Set it's PP to 3, regardless of the max PP of that move

A common problem with permanent consumables like this is that players are disincentivized to use them at all, since the player does not know what enemies they may have to face in the future. To address this, rat_game includes what will surely be a contentious. Everytime the player saves the game at a savepoint, which, during a first play-through, is non-optional, all consumables will loose a point of durability. If the durability reaches 0, the consumable will be automatically discarded at the end of the next battle. Because the consumable only decays in the next battle, saving right before a big boss will not punish the player, as they can still use the consumables. If saving in a regular area however, players will not be able stock up on consumables and hoard them. This mechanics also eliminates potential exploits where a consumable that is received very early in the game can't be used to break a later boss fight. Because of this, rat_games design is able to supply extremely powerful consumables without affecting game-balance.

All consumables have the same durability, and its exact value will be chosen during the playtesting phase.

## 2.4 Equipment

Equipment are equivalent to gear in other games. In the overworld or after a battle, a player may receive a new piece of equipment. Each party members equipment can be changed in the inventory menu. 

When a new equpment is obtained, a small cutscene plays that shows the name of the item and its properties in clear text, see example below. Once the player presses A, they regain control and the item is added to their inventory.

### 2.4.1 Effects of Equipment Types

An entity has a fixed number of equipment slots, in which it can equip items of a special type: equipment. Equipment comes in four kinds, 

+ **rings** are small jewelry worn by humans or any non-human with an appendage the size of a human finger
+ **weapons** are things like swords, knifes, slingshots, etc. Only equippable by adult humans 
+ **clothing** are wearable such as shirts, scarfs, hats, armor, etc.
+ **special** are an equipment type that can only be worn by a certain character

Equpment of any kind can have any effect, though things like clothing or armor is more likely to increase defense, while weapons will increase damage output. Special-type items will usually modify a property of a character itself, see below.

Equipments have the following properties:

+ `hp_increase`: Positive Integer, increase maximum HP of the equipped character
+ `attack_increase`: Possibly negative integer, increases ATK by a flat amount
+ `defense_increase`: see above, but for DEF
+ `speed_increase`: see above, but for SPD

Additionally, equipment can have more free-form, passive effects. Passive effects are effects available as long as the character is not knocked out or dead, similar to a non-volatile status condition. Examples including regenerating 1/16th of user.max_hp at the end of each turn, or lowering an enemies attack whenever they damage the wearer.

### 2.4.2 Equipment Slots

The number and type of equipment slots depends on the entity and should have an in-lore explanation, for example a spider enemy may be able to wear 8 rings, one on each leg, but should be unable to wield a weapon or wear human clothing. A small girl should be unable to wear an adults coat, etc.

The equipment slot and type distribution for all playable characters is as follows:

| Character | # Weapons | # Clothing | # Trinkets | Special Slot?                                                                    |
|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `$MC`     | 2 | 1          | 2          | no                                                                               |
| `$RAT`    | 0 | 0          | 4          | **Mouse-sized Item** [1]: Determines `$RAT`s intrinsic move                      |
| `$GIRL`     | 0 | 1          | 1          | **Backpack**: Determines number consumable slots in inventory                    |
| `$PROF`     | 1 | 1          | 2          | **Glasses**: modifies the effect of the `ANALYZE` intrinsic move                 |
| `$SCOUT`    | 1 | 1          | 2          | no                                                                               |
| `$WILDCARD` | 2 | 1          | 2          | **Feathered Hat**: Prevents wearer from selecting the `PROTECT` intrinsic action |

[1] Such as "mouse-sized collar", "mouses-size sock", "mouse-sized piece of cheese"

While any piece of equipment of a certain type can be equipped to any entity with a matching slot, the slot distribution and special item allow the developer to steer characters into a certain type of build, for example, since weapons will usually aid in offensive tasks, `$MC` and `$WILDCARD` are naturally more likely to be the damage dealers, while $GIRL is both defensless and weaponless, but her backpack allows her to be useful and more flexible than others in combat by stock-piling various kinds of consumables, which would occupy valuable consumable slots on other characters.

Lastly, `$RAT` has the greatest build variety, as 4 trinket slots (on for each leg), as well as being able to choose the intrinsic move allows it to fullfill any role.

Enemies being able to wear equipment, while rare, gives valuable opportunity for gamedesign purposes in the case when equipment has active or passive abilities. For example a somewhat complicated piece of equipment with an active effect could first be put onto an enemy. The player fights the enemy and will naturally trigger the equipments ability. After the fight is won, the player will loot the new piece of equipment and will have been seamlessly taught how it works and if it is worth using. 

### 2.4.3 Equipment Examples

The following is a list of equipment demonstrating the type of effects that are available. Note that the effect text given here is not intended for players, in-game a more appropriate and shortened version will be used.

> ``ULTRALIGHT_BOOTS`` (Clothing)<br>
> -25 DEF | + 50 SPD<br>
> No additional effect

> ``BALL_AND_CHAIN`` (Trinket) <br>
> SPD is treated as negative infinity at all times.

> ``NOVELTY_SODA_HAT`` (Clothing)<br>
> (no stat buffs)<br>
> Restores 1/16th at the end of the turn during for first 5 turns of the battle

> ``LONG_NIGHT_KNIFE`` (Weapon)<br>
> ATK: +50<br>
> Causes the target to be affected with `BLEED` status condition if the user selected the `STRIKE` intrinsic move

>``ASSAULT_VEST`` (Clothing)<br>
> (no stat buffs)<br>
> User starts the battle with +3 DEF. If a move does not deal damage, it may not be selected. Excludes intrinsic moves.

>``FEATHERED_HEAD`` (Special)<br>
> (no stat buffs)<br>
> Can only be equipped to `$WILDCARD`. At the end of each turn, raises users ATK by one level. User may not choose the `PROTECT` intrinsic move

> ``MOUSE_SIZED_CHEESE`` (Special)<br>
> (no stat buffs)<br>
> Can only be equipped to `$RAT`. The first time the `STRIKE` intrinsic move is selected during a battle, it instead restores HP equal to 0.5 * user.max_hp.  

> ``VARIFOCAL_GLASSES`` (Special)<br>
> (no stat buffs) <br>
> Can only be equipped to `$PROF`. The `ANALYZE` intrinsic move now reveals the enemies health bar and PP count for any move used in battle so far.

### 2.4.4 Equipment Implementation

The equipment class has the following gameplay-relevant properties:

```c
class Equipment {
    unsigned int hp_modifier
    int attack_modifier
    int defense_modifier
    int speed_modifier
    
    Function on_action_taken    // (self, action, origin, damage) -> void
    Function on_action_dealt    // (self, action, target, damage) -> void
    Function on_turn_start      // (self) -> void
    Function on_turn_end        // (self) -> void
    
    Function on_equip           // (self) -> void
}
```

Where `on_action_taken` is called anytime the wearer of the equipment takes damage or is otherwise affected by an enemies move, while `on_action_dealt` activates when the wearer does the same to a target.

`on_equip` modifies a non-battle properties of the wearer when it is equipped in the inventory menu. Changes include modifying the number of move / equipment slots, adding / disabling an intrinsic move, applying a non-flat stat buff, etc.

## 2.x AI & Enemy Design

### 2.x Tutorial Fights

rat_game contains no explicit tutorials, instead, all gameplay mechanics should be conveyed through gameplay only.

### 2.x AI

AI aims to be sophisticated yet fair. Enemies will have 3 levels of AI, called random, memory, and no-memory. An overview of how these three versions act will be given here.

One turn of battle will resolve as following:

1. Apply effects that trigger at the start of the turn
2. Sort all entites by speed / priority
3. Ask each entity to choose an action to perform, if the entity is player controlled, the player picks the action. If it is not, AI picks the action.
4. In order of priority, resolve each entites action.
5. Apply effects that trigger at the end of the turn

We see that the AIs job is to choose exactly one action from a list of actions. During choosing, the AI has access to the following information about the player character:

+ current and max HP
+ Stat alterations
+ status ailments
+ PP count of moves at least used once this battle

For "memory"-type AI only, the following are also available

+ for each turn so far, the state of the entire battle that turn
+ history of which moves the player used on which character so far
+ moves that are chosen by other enemies during this and all previous turns

Notably, the AI is not aware of which moves the player has chosen the current turn, it has to make a decision solely based on the battles history and parts of the player entities state. The idea is that memory-type AI can make use only of all "public information".

#### Decision Making Algorithms

Each turn, the AI has the following task: given the current state of the battle and all other information available, choose exactly 1 move from each enemy entities moveset. 

For multiple enemies, "memory"-type AI will choose all enemies moves wholistically, meaning each enemy does not think indepednently, they are planning as a group. This is similar to how the player acts, choosing multiple moves as a combination, while "random"- and "no-memry"-type AI does not take into account the actions of other enemies.

#### Random AI

"Random"-type AI is the most simple AI, it will choose a move from the enemy moveset randomly, where each moves occurence is weighted by the number of PP:

```lua
available_moves = {}
for move in moveset do
    for i = 1, move.current_pp do
        table.insert(available_moves, move)
    end
end 

which_index = rt.random.integer(1, sizeof(available_moves))
return available_moves[which_index]
```

By inserting multiple copies of the same move into `moveset`, choosing a uniformly distributed number between 1 and the number of moves times the number of available PP, each moves probability is weighted by its available PP. This has two reason, for one it prevents the AI from choosing a move that has 0 PP left. Furthermore, moves that have a higher number of max PP will be more likely to be chosen at the start of the battle, while rare, one-time moves will be rarely chosen at the start, but as the total number of PP decrease each turn, their likelihood increases.

Note that, like all randomness in rat_game, the actual result of `rt.random.integer` is determinstic, meaning if the player chooses the same actions after they start the battle, the battle will resolve in exactly the same way. Player actions advance the RNG state in order to prevent enemies from always picking the same actions every turn. This way, the RNG is is still wholly determinstic and in the players control, but each battle will be different.

Random-type AI is limited to enemies with a very small moveset, or lesser enemies such as adds spawned next to bosses, or enemies in fights at the start of the game.

#### No-Memory AI



### 2.x.1 In-Battle UI

During any point in battle, the following information should be available to the player.

For each party member:

+ current hp and max hp
+ exact speed stat
+ current attack, defense and speed level
+ priority
+ list of all status ailments

For each enemy:

+ current attack, defense, and speed level, unless it is 0
+ priority
+ list of all status ailments

By using $PROFs `ANALYZE`, the following information also becomes available

+ current hp divided by max hp, in %

One one side of the screen, the priority queue should be shown. This is the 


## Verbose Info Panel

Entity:

| stat | format     | as party | as enemy |
|------|------------|----------|----------|
| name | TestEntity | yes      | yes      |
| hp current | 98 / 100 |
